<!-- 1. During compilation just before the execution of the code, all the variable/function declaration are moved to the top of the scope, this is called hoisting
     2. This is applicable to all identifier declarations made by var, let, const
**** 3. Identifiers declared using let and const are also hoisted, but you cannot access those before intialization. Untill intialization they remain in Temporal Dead Zone.
        We can only access variable with let or const identifiers only if they are intialised before accessing them. Untill then they remain in temporal deadzone.
